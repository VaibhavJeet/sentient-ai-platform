"""
Emergent Community Formation

Bots organically create, join, and leave communities based on:
- Shared interest clusters that no existing community serves
- Cultural movements that need a dedicated space
- Friend-of-friend social discovery
- Fading interests causing bots to drift away

Communities themselves have a lifecycle — they grow, stagnate, and can die.
